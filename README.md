# Maturaarbeit Physics Engine
This is the finished source code for my Maturaarbeit.  
It is a simple 2d Ridgid body physics engine.  
It Supports n sided convex polygon shapes.  
It still contains some bugs which sadly couldn't be fixed during my Maturaarbeit.  
This Project was made for Learning Purposes only.
